# Jaspher Pasol Portfolio Site
Hi! I'm Jaspher Pasol, Software Engineer, started out as a simple CompEngr graduate that leveraged his experience in VB6, to transition to C#, and now as a frontend Developer using Angular.

My Goal is to be simply a Software Engineer, following the principle not the tool, expressing my artistic passion where tools doesn't make the art, but the artist itself. 

But this project doesn't necessarily mean it will capture color or invoke emotions, but instead its a canvas for expression when practicing software engineering principles, and ideas.

## Objective
To Generate a Portfolio Website that showcases all the work and experiences i had over my career and showcase my skills as a software engineer.

## General

## Modules
### Homepage

## README
This File will also serve as the application's repository of change. this tracks all improvements, and will be the overview of the application and its truth.

For every issue, there should be a branch, and within that branch, the first commit will be the changes. 
So by the time that the feature branch is merge and main is updated, this README also takes note of its changes.
